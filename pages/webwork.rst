WeBWorK
=======

Runestone Academy offers hosting for WeBWorK courses. We do this to give greater access to WeBWorK,
especially for institutions that do not have their own WeBWorK server.


Cost
----

Through Summer 2025 and possibly longer, the cost is:

- $100 per course unit for primary and secondary institutions.
- $120 per course unit for higher ed institutions.

For a bulk discount, every 6th course unit for higher ed has no cost. This only applies at the time
of invoicing. You are welcome to preorder course units for a future term/semester, as long as it's
not more than 8 months in advance. (Since this hosting service is only promised annually, we can't
accept orders too far into the future.)

A "course unit" covers up to 60 students. If a course surpasses that (and for each multiple of 60
it surpasses) it will incur an additional course unit to the invoice.

Runestone will send an invoice once you are using the course(s) with actual students, and we count
how many. However you may request to be invoiced early.

Restrictions
------------

We ask that no one use this service to administer tests on a large, simultaneous scale. A typical
course of 30 students simultaneously taking a test is OK, but if coincidentally lots of other
courses have simultaneous testing, it could cause a spike in server resource load that slows things
down for everyone to a halt. So it is best to plan to not use timed tests with this service, or if
you do, to plan for times that are unlikely to overlap with other users.

FAQ
---

   #.  Is WeBWorK accessible?

       Yes, WeBWorK itself is considered very accessibile, and has an `Accessibility Guide
       <https://webwork.maa.org/wiki/Accessibility_Guide>`_. It is always possible for individual
       exercises in WeBWorK to have been coded without proper concern for accessibility issues, but
       for the most part, individual exercises are accessible. When they are not, the instructor
       has access to edit them to become accessible.

   #.  Will I be able to integrate my WeBWorK course with my LMS?

       Probably. We will work with you to set that up. It does require some collaboration between
       us at the WeBWorK end, and you working within your LMS team. The connection can use either
       LTI 1.1 or LTI 1.3. Single sign-on to WeBWorK from the LMS is possible, as is grade
       passback from WeBWorK to the LMS. Depending on how your institution manages its LMS, you may
       need the LMS team to grant you permission. And again depending on your institution, there
       may be a lengthy review process for that.

   #.  Where do I find problems to use?

       Within WeBWorK there is an Open Problem Library with tens of thousands of contributed
       exercises. These exercises are tagged so you can search for what you would like to find.
       Depending on the subject area, we may be able to put you in contact with problem authors who
       will license their problems to you with no hassle. You may also write/code your own WeBWorK
       exercises. There is a strong
       `user community <https://webwork.maa.org/moodle/mod/forum/index.php?id=3>`_ and `wiki site
       <https://webwork.maa.org/wiki/Main_Page>`_ to help with this.
       We also provide access to a few addtional libraries of questions associated with openly
       licensed testbooks.

   #.  What about pre-packaged ready-to-go courses?

       Depending on what you need, we may be able to set you up with something. A few examples are
       visible at `the Runestone WeBWorK site <https://webwork.runestone.academy/webwork2/>`_. There
       are more model courses we can load for you as well.

   #.  What kind of tech support can I expect?

       If something is not working with the WeBWorK course, you can contact
       `Alex <alex@runestone.academy>`_ to look into it and work on it. Response times will vary
       between immediate and 48 hours later. If something is not working with an individual WeBWorK
       problem, that is a different matter. See the next question.

   #.  Something is not working with a WeBWorK problem. Or it has an accessibility issue. Or I want
       to design a new WeBWorK problem that behaves in a certain way. If I am not able to work it
       out using the user forums and reference information at the wiki, what can I do?

       `Alex <alex@runestone.academy>`_ may be available to debug an existing WeBWorK problem or
       design a template problem from scratch. This depends on how busy life is at that time. But
       there is always the WeBWorK-using community mentioned above to support you.

   #.  What if I invest my time in this service, setting up some WeBWorK courses, but then I have
       to leave? For example, if this service goes away or it becomes a service with a fee that I
       am not able to pay. Will I be able to keep my content?

       Yes, each WeBWorK course can be archived into a file that you can take with you. This file
       includes all of the course setup that you put in place, as well as student data. Then you
       can upload this file into another WeBWorK server and reconsitute the course. Generating this
       file is something that we must do for you, but we will always be able to do that when you
       ask.

   #.  Will this service go away someday?

       Maybe, but we know that faculty cannot turn on a dime. (Well, they can when the need arises,
       but they should not be forced to.) So if this service ever goes away, we will alert all users
       sometime before the end of June and then continue operating all the way through any summer
       courses, shutting down before Fall.

   #.  What about student data privacy?

       The only users with access to your student data are you and the faculty you add to the
       course, and Runestone Academy administrators. Runestone Academy will not access your student
       data except in the course of assisting you with an issue. Please see the Runestone Academy
       `Privacy Policy <https://runestone.academy/runestone/default/privacy>`_ and 
       `Terms of Use <https://runestone.academy/runestone/default/terms>`_ for more details.

       If you do not use integration with an LMS, there is the option to make up aliases for
       students and omit their email addresses, so that the Runestone WeBWorK server never has
       actual personal identifiable information.

       If you *do* use integration with an LMS, then depending on the LMS it may be possible to 
       configure the External Tool (in the LMS) to use something that is not personal identifiable
       information as the student's WeBWorK ID.

   #.  I'm in Canada, or Europe, or someplace where the local laws and policies make it problematic
       for me to put student data on your server. What can I do?

       For starters, see the options mentioned in the previosu item. But if there are still
       concerns, read on. We use cloud computing that is based in the US, but we have looked into
       the possibility of moving to a Toronto-based data center. If there is enough demand, we will
       make that move and we hope it helps smooth things out for you. Wherever you are, please look
       into the details of the local laws and policies before getting yourself in any trouble. It
       may help to consider using this WeBWorK hosting without using LMS integration.
