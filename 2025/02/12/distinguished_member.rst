Miller Named Distinguished Member of the ACM
============================================

Runestone Academy founder and president, Dr. Bradley Miller, has been named a Distinguished Member of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) for his contributions to the development of recommender systems for eCommerce and interactive textbooks for computer science and mathematics. The ACM is the world's largest educational and scientific computing society, and this honor is given to only 1% of its members.  Dr. Miller was recognized for his work in the development of the Runestone Interactive platform, which has been used by over 1 million students and teachers around the world to learn computer science.  He has also been a leader in the development of open educational resources (OER) and has been a strong advocate for the use of technology in education.

"Each year we look forward to selecting a new class of ACM Distinguished Members from among our worldwide association of 110,000 colleagues," explained ACM President Yannis Ioannidis. "ACM's motto is 'advancing computing as a science and profession.'"

I am really honored to be recognized by the ACM for my work in computer science education and open educational resources.  I have been fortunate to work with many talented people over the years, and this award is a reflection of their hard work as well.  I am especially grateful to the Runestone team for their dedication and commitment to making computer science education accessible to all.  As a Professor Emeritus of Luther College, I'm especially proud of this honor; if you look at the other 55 people named this year they are from Google, Microsoft, and lots of prestigious research universities around the world.  I am proud to be a part of this community and to be able to contribute to the advancement of computing as a science and profession.  I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues in the field to make computer science education more accessible and effective for all students.
